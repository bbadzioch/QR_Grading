Dear {fname},

I am attaching an pdf file containing your graded MTH 309 Exam 1.
The 'Piazza' box in the score table shows the bonus points for posting
a welcome message on Piazza at the beginning of the semester.
The 'Hill' box is the percentage bonus for the Hill cipher extra credit assignment.

Exam 1 statistics are as follows:
Mean: 76
Median: 78
Standard deviation: 16

Best regards,

Bernard Badzioch
